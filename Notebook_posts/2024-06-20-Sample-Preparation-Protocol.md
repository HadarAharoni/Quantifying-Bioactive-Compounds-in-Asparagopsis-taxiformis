3. Lysis buffer and storaging. 
4. DNA extraction.
5. Nano-Drop: testing the samples.

7. PCR protocol. 
8. Electrophoresis.
9. Packing for delivery. 

## Collecting algeas from the sea: 
#### Materials
- Diving gear
- Mesh bags
- Bucket with seawater

#### Procedure

1. **Site Selection and Preparation**
   - Return to the predetermined collection site.
   - Ensure all equipment is prepared and functioning before diving.

2. **Identification of Colonies**
   - Identify three distinct colonies of *Asparagopsis taxiformis*.
   - Ensure that each colony (referred to as "foreigner") is at least 3 meters apart to maintain sample diversity.

3. **Collection of Specimens**
   - Approach the first colony (Foreigner 1).
   - Collect as much *Asparagopsis taxiformis* as possible from the colony, ensuring minimal disturbance to the surrounding environment.
   - Place the collected algae into a mesh bag and securely close it.
   - Repeat the process for the second colony (Foreigner 2), placing the collected specimens in a separate mesh bag.
   - Repeat the process for the third colony (Foreigner 3), placing the collected specimens in a third mesh bag.

4. **Transport to Surface**
   - Once all three colonies have been sampled, return to the surface with the mesh bags.
   - Place the mesh bags into a bucket filled with seawater immediately to preserve specimen integrity.

5. **Documentation**
   - Note the location and any relevant details about each colony.
   - Ensure each mesh bag is labeled or identified in a manner that distinguishes which colony it came from (Foreigner 1, Foreigner 2, Foreigner 3).

## Collecting samples from the different parts of the algea: 
#### Materials
- *Asparagopsis taxiformis* samples
- Swabs
- Labeled test tubes
- Lysis Buffer

#### Procedure

1. **Preparation**
   - Place the *Asparagopsis taxiformis* specimens on the laboratory table.

2. **Sampling**
   - **Blade**: Rub a swab on the blade. Place the swab in a labeled test tube with 0.7 ml lysis buffer lysis buffer.
   - **Stipe**: Rub a new swab on the stipe. Place the swab in a separate labeled test tube with 0.7 ml lysis buffer.
   - **Holdfast**: Rub another new swab on the holdfast. Place the swab in its own labeled test tube with 0.7 ml lysis buffer lysis buffer.

3. **Documentation**
   - Label each test tube with the part of the algae and the colony identifier (Foreigner 1, 2, or 3).

6. Add 500 µl phenol *pH=8* to each eppendorf, vortex 1 minute, centrifuge 1 minute full speed. **Throw away the top layer ~ 500 µl**. 
7. Add 450 µl 1:1 phenol:chloroform, vortex 1 minute, centrifuge 1 minute full speed. **Top layer into new eppendorf ~ 400 µl**. 
8. Add 400 µl 1:1 phenol:chloroform, vortex 1 minute, centrifuge 1 minute full speed. **Top layer into new eppendorf ~ 300 µl**. 
9. Add 30 µl of 3 M NaOAc *pH=5.2* and 600 µl of absolute freeze EtOH. 
10. Vortex and keep at -20 °C over night or 20 minutes at -80 °C. 
11. Centrifuge for 15 minutes at 4 °C full speed. Spill the liquide. 
12. Add 1 ml freeze EtOH 80%, let stand 2 minutes, spin for 5 minutes at 4 °C, dry pellet. 
13. Add 50 µl DEPC water to each eppendorf. 
14. Examine the quality and quantity of the DNA using Nano Drop. 

## Nano-Drop: testing the samples:


#### Materials
- DNA samples
- NanoDrop spectrophotometer
- Micro-pipettes (2 µL to 10 µL)
- Pipette tips
- Nuclease-free water or appropriate buffer (e.g., TE buffer)
- Kimwipes or lint-free wipes

#### Procedure

1. **Preparation**
   - Turn on the NanoDrop spectrophotometer and allow it to warm up for at least 5 minutes.
   - Open the NanoDrop software on the connected computer.

2. **Blank Measurement**
   - Select the appropriate program for DNA measurement on the NanoDrop software (e.g., "Nucleic Acids" or "dsDNA").
   - Raise the sample arm and ensure that the measurement pedestal is clean. If necessary, clean it with a Kimwipe moistened with nuclease-free water.
   - Pipette 1-2 µL of nuclease-free water or the buffer used to dissolve the DNA onto the lower measurement pedestal.
   - Lower the sample arm and click "Blank" in the software to calibrate the NanoDrop with the blank solution.
   - After the measurement, lift the sample arm and wipe both the upper and lower pedestals with a clean, dry Kimwipe.

3. **Sample Measurement**
   - Ensure the pedestals are clean and dry after the blank measurement.
   - Vortex the DNA sample briefly to ensure homogeneity.
   - Pipette 1-2 µL of the DNA sample onto the lower measurement pedestal.
   - Lower the sample arm and click "Measure" in the software.
   - Record the DNA concentration (ng/µL) and the purity ratios (A260/A280 and A260/A230).

4. **Post-Measurement**
   - Lift the sample arm and clean both pedestals with a clean, dry Kimwipe.
   - Repeat the measurement for additional samples, ensuring to clean the pedestals between each sample.


#### Data Interpretation
- **DNA Concentration**: The concentration of DNA is given in ng/µL. The expected range for high-quality DNA is typically between 50 ng/µL to 2000 ng/µL.
- **Purity Ratios**:
  - **A260/A280 Ratio**: Indicates protein contamination. Pure DNA should have a ratio of ~1.8.
  - **A260/A230 Ratio**: Indicates contamination by organic compounds and salts. Pure DNA should have a ratio of ~2.0-2.2.


#### Troubleshooting
- **Low A260/A280 Ratio**: Indicates possible protein contamination. Consider further purification.
- **Low A260/A230 Ratio**: Indicates possible contamination by phenol, guanidine, or other organic compounds. Consider further purification.
- **No Reading**: Ensure the sample is properly applied to the pedestal and that the pedestal is clean. Recalibrate with the blank solution if necessary.


## Dilution:

All samples should reach a concentration of 1 microliter per ml. To achieve this, we will take the concentration obtained from the measurement (in nanomolar) and dilute the sample to reach the target concentration of 1 microliter per ml. We will use the formula: 
\( C_1 \times V_1 = C_2 \times V_2 \).

Where:

\( C_1 \) = Initial concentration (in nanomolar)

\( V_1 \) = Initial volume (in ml)

\( C_2 \) = Desired concentration (1 microliter per ml)

\( V_2 \) = Final volume (in ml)
