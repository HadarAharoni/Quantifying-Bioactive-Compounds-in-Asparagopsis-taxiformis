### Bromine compounds under stress ###

The *algae Asparagopsis taxiformis* is known for its ability to produce bromine compounds. These bromine compounds are secondary natural substances, meaning they significantly affect the algae itself and related organisms but are not essential for the algae's survival. Therefore, **I hypothesize that under stress conditions such as extreme heat, high salinity, and high acidity, the production of bromine compounds will decrease as energy is diverted towards producing compounds necessary for survival.**

It is known that the enzyme linked to the production of bromine compounds is vanadium-dependent haloperoxidase (VHP), and the genes encoding it are located in the marine CHBrâ‚ƒ biosynthesis (mbb) locus, including mbb1, mbb2, mbb3, and mbb4. To test this hypothesis, I will expose the algae to various stress conditions associated with global warming (extreme heat, high salinity, and high acidity) and use qPCR to measure changes in the expression of genes responsible for VHP production. **The hypothesis is that more extreme conditions will result in a lower expression of these genes, reflecting reduced production of the enzyme.**

As a reference gene, I will use the rbcL gene, which encodes the large subunit of RuBisCO. This is the most abundant protein in the cell, and its expression level is generally stable and not expected to change significantly under various stress conditions. Therefore, rbcL provides a reliable baseline for normalizing gene expression in qPCR experiments.
