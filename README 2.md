Following your first attempt to open a repository on GitHub and using Markdown during the class.
We ask you to write a protocol (subject of your choice) and push it to your **"metadata folder"** following the requested guideline:
 
#### 1. The protocol must be written in a text editor of your choice between *Markdown*, *Atom* or *Visual Studio*.

#### 2. _Within this protocol you will need to have the following points (a-f):_ 

**(a)** Organize titles in different font size

**(b)** Use **bold**, *italic* and _underline_ in the protocol
 
**(c)** Insert photos with captions  
For example:   
   
![colonie_figure_sesesame.png](https://pierrickharnay.github.io/PierrickHarnay_Notebook/images/colonie_figure_sesesame.png) 

Figure 1: Colonie of *Pocillopora spp.* in the lagoon of Mo'orea at different flow regime.  

**(d)** Insert tables (screenshots not allowed) that include 6 columns, 6 raws and a title to each columnn     
For example:   

| Date | Site | Coral cover | Algae cover | CCA cover | ... |
|------|------|-------------|-------------|-----------|-----|
|      |      |             |             |           |     |
